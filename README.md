## Note about C++
Unfortunately, RobotC does not support C++, only C. However, it mixes in some C++ ideas that my IDE, CLion, will show errors about. I discovered that if I save the file as a C++ file, both peices of software are happy.

Today, our team won the Excellence award at the [state qualifier game in Sheffield, Ohio](https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-iq-challenge/RE-VIQC-17-3799.html). The code shown in this repository was a key factor to us winning, along with some additional research. We will be going to the Ohio State Championship in February.
